# theGeneratorOf_Passwords


## Description

For challenge 03, we were prompted to create a random password generator using JavaScript. The goal for this project was to provide the user with a series of prompts to generate a random password. This project was very difficult, but also very rewarding. After creating the password generator, I can read code better, and I have a better understanding on how to put code together. I'm happy with the outcome of this challenge and I hope someone finds my generator useful when they are in need of a new password.
